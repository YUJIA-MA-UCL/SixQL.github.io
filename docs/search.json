Do not edit any of the headings.\n\n\nWhat is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?\nThe Russian-Ukrainian war caused a lot of damage to buildings and roads. This application analyses the extent of damage to buildings and roads in Kharkiv and Mariupol, one of the most severely damaged cities. The system will rely on the GEE platform, combined with the T-test, to quantify the types of damaged buildings and roads, the damaged area of different types of buildings and the length of damaged roads, and to provide a scientific basis for decision-making in post-disaster reconstruction, resource allocation and urban planning.\n\n\n\nWho are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?\nThe end-users of the system include: 1. Government and administration departments (e.g. urban planning, post-disaster reconstruction and emergency management agencies in Ukraine); 2. Humanitarian organisations (e.g. United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) 3. Scientific research institutes engaged in urban studies and disaster assessment.\n\n\n\nWhat data are you using?\nWe used data from + Building Footprints data from Overture Maps Foundation ; + Road Network data from OSM? + Sentinel-1 data from Google Earth Engine.\n\n\n\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\nWe used Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to perform a pixel statistical test (t-test) for pre- and post-war changes, identifying potential damage on the map. Overlaying the building footprints and road network data with t-test results to locate and classify damage, and calculate the percentage of damaged buildings and roads, and different subtypes of damaged buildings at 95% confidence intervals. Through monthly monitoring of post-war damages for 12 months after 2022-2-24, the evolution of the war impact will be tracked, and user can select different times to view changes in damages. These features will support urban damage assessment and post-war reconstruction planning.\n\n\n\nHow does your application’s interface work to address the needs of your end user?\n\n\n\n\nReplace the link below with the link to your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
