### Problem Statement

What is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?

This application addresses the need for transparent, cost-effective tools to assess infrastructure damage in urban areas affected by the Russia–Ukraine war. It focuses on Kharkiv and Mariupol, the two most affected cities, and estimates building and road damage using a lightweight, unsupervised pixel-wise t-test on freely available Sentinel-1 imagery. Although the war is ongoing, our analysis focuses on the year before and after February 24, 2022, when the full-scale invasion began. Unlike deep learning approaches requiring expensive optical imagery, this method supports repeatable, scalable, and interpretable analysis. The results can assist post-war reconstruction planning, guide humanitarian aid, and inform public understanding of urban destruction patterns in these cities.

### End User

Who are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?

1.  Government and planning departments: Initial analyze damage patterns and damage to specific facilities (e.g. housing, hospitals) to prioritise reconstruction and allocate resources effectively.
2.  Humanitarian organisations: Quickly identify severely damaged areas and assess damage to critical infrastructure and residential areas to provide guidance for emergency shelter, public health and logistics planning.
3.  Remote sensing and disaster assessment professionals: Use damage data to validate models, track changes, and compare methods or datasets in disaster impact studies.
4.  Public and media: Explore clear, visual maps of war damage, thereby raising public awareness, and can provide data to support news reporting.

### Data

What data are you using?

-   Sentinel-1 Imagery\
    This application uses Sentinel-1 Imagery provided by [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/sentinel1). To simplify processing and prioritize sensitivity to structural damage, only VH-polarized imagery was used. The data spans February 24, 2020 to February 24, 2023, covering placebo, pre-war, and war phases. From February 2022, imagery was compared monthly to capture temporal changes in damage.

-   Building Footprints\
    Building footprint data is sourced from the [Overture Maps Foundation](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/buildings/#14/32.58453/-117.05154/0/60), which combines several open datasets, primarily from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft, and Google Open Buildings. Buildings smaller than 50 m² were excluded due to potential building false positives and the resolution of Sentinel-1.

-   Road Networks\
    The road network data was retrieved from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) using the OSMnx package in Python, extracting roads classified as trunk, primary, secondary, and tertiary, and simplifying bidirectional edges.

### Methodology

How are you using this data to address the problem?

We used Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to perform a pixel statistical test (t-test) for pre- and post-war changes, identifying potential damage on the map. Overlaying the building footprints and road network data with t-test results to locate and classify damage, and calculate the percentage of damaged buildings and roads, and different subtypes of damaged buildings at 95% confidence intervals. Through monthly monitoring of post-war damages for 12 months after 2022-2-24, the evolution of the war impact will be tracked, and user can select different times to view changes in damages. These features will support urban damage assessment and post-war reconstruction planning.

### Interface

How does your application's interface work to address the needs of your end user?

The application provides clear, visual maps of war damage, enabling the public and researchers in remote sensing and disaster assessment to track the evolution of destruction and the recovery process over time. Layer comparison tools help Ukrainian government and humanitarian organizations visually identify specific areas are affected, supporting resource planning and decision-making for wartime relief and post-disaster reconstruction. The application also calculates the proportion of damaged buildings and roads, and visualizes the distribution of damage across different building types, offering reference statistics for researchers. All users can export damaged building GeoJSON data to conduct urban assessments and make data-driven decisions.

## How it Works

### Data Input and Processing

We imported the vector data, including building footprints with building type information and 7.5-meter-wide rectangular road layers, and merged the data from two cities.

``` js
// ------------------------------------------------- Import Data  ---------------------------------------------- 
// Building footprint
var buildings_ukr1 = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-yiyaocui/assets/ukr1");
var buildings_ukr7 = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-yiyaocui/assets/ukr7");
var buildings = buildings_ukr1.merge(buildings_ukr7);

// Roads
var roads_ukr1 = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-yiyaocui/assets/osm_ukr1_buffer_50_75_8")
  .filterBounds(aoi);
var roads_ukr7 = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-yiyaocui/assets/osm_ukr7_buffer_50_75_14")
  .filterBounds(aoi);
var roads = roads_ukr1.merge(roads_ukr7);
```

Then, we set up our area of interest (AOI), time range, and map’s centroids. For time range:

-   SHOCK_DATE: 2022-02-24, when Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
-   PRE_INTERVAL: 12-month pre-event period (baseline).
-   POST_INTERVAL: 12-month post-event period (all assessment windows).

We defined a updateDateRanges() function to flexibly select an assessment window for the interactive tool.

``` js
// ------------------------------------------------- Set-up  ---------------------------------------------- 
//AOI
var cityBoundaries = ee.FeatureCollection("projects/ee-yiyaocui/assets/unosat_aois")
  .style({
    color: 'red', 
    fillColor: '00000000',
    width: 1 
  });
var aoi = cityBoundaries.geometry();
var ukr1 = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([37.46, 47.06, 37.72, 47.16]);
var ukr7 = ee.Geometry.Rectangle([36.09, 49.87, 36.46, 50.11]);  
var aoi = ee.FeatureCollection([
  ee.Feature(ukr1),
  ee.Feature(ukr7)
]).merge(ee.FeatureCollection([])).geometry();

//Time 
var SHOCK_DATE = "2022-02-24";
var PRE_INTERVAL = 12;  // month before the event
var POST_INTERVAL = 12; // month after the event
// Calculate precise data filtering range, recalculate when POST_INTERVAL changes
function updateDateRanges() {
  var startDate = ee.Date(SHOCK_DATE).advance(-PRE_INTERVAL, "month").format("YYYY-MM-dd");
  var endDate = ee.Date(SHOCK_DATE).advance(POST_INTERVAL, "month").format("YYYY-MM-dd");
  return {startDate: startDate, endDate: endDate};
}
// Initialize date range
var dateRanges = updateDateRanges();
var startDate = dateRanges.startDate;
var endDate = dateRanges.endDate; 

// Centroid
Map.centerObject(cityBoundaries, 8);

// Centroid of mariupol 
var mariupolCenter = ee.Geometry.Point([37.59269, 47.09966]);
Map.centerObject(mariupolCenter, 14);
```

Based on the tutorial code from CASA0025 Week 9 (Ballinger, O. (2024)), we used the following equation to compute the t-value for each pixel, comparing radar backscatter values before and after the war:

$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$

Where:

-   $\overline{x_1}$：mean of the pre-war imagery // code variables: pre-mean
-   $\overline{x_2}$：mean of the post-war imagery // code variables: post_mean
-   $s_1^2, s_2^2$：variance of the pre- and post-war data // code variables: pre_sd, post_sd; $s^2$ is implied as $sd^2$
-   $n_1, n_2$：number of images before and after the war // code variables: pre_n, post_n

This approach helps quantify whether observed changes are statistically significant and is particularly useful when ground-truth data is limited. Finally, a t-value greater than 2.5 indicates a significant change at the 99% confidence level.

``` js
// -------------------------------------- TTest function  ----------------------------------------------
// t-test function (building analysis)
function ttest(s1, shock, pre_interval, post_interval) {
  // Convert event date to ee.Date object
  var shock = ee.Date(shock);
  // Filter pre-event images: from (shock - pre_interval months) to shock
  var pre = s1.filterDate(
    shock.advance(ee.Number(pre_interval).multiply(-1), "month"),
    shock
  );
  // Filter post-event images: from shock to (shock + post_interval months)
  var post = s1.filterDate(shock, shock.advance(post_interval, "month"));
  // Calculate pre-event mean, standard deviation, and image count
  var pre_mean = pre.mean();
  var pre_sd = pre.reduce(ee.Reducer.stdDev());
  var pre_n = ee.Number(pre.filterBounds(aoi).size());
  // Calculate post-event mean, standard deviation, and image count
  var post_mean = post.mean();
  var post_sd = post.reduce(ee.Reducer.stdDev());
  var post_n = ee.Number(post.filterBounds(aoi).size());
  // Print pre and post event image counts for debugging
  print('Pre-event images count: ', pre_n);
  print('Post-event images count: ', post_n);
  // Calculate pooled standard deviation
  var pooled_sd = pre_sd
    .multiply(pre_sd)
    .multiply(pre_n.subtract(1))
    .add(post_sd.multiply(post_sd).multiply(post_n.subtract(1)))
    .divide(pre_n.add(post_n).subtract(2))
    .sqrt();
  // Calculate denominator part of t-test formula
  var denom = pooled_sd.multiply(
    ee.Number(1).divide(pre_n).add(ee.Number(1).divide(post_n)).sqrt()
  );
  // Calculate degrees of freedom (number of observations minus 2)
  var df = pre_n.add(post_n).subtract(2);
  print("Number of Images: ", df);
  // Calculate t-value: absolute difference of means divided by denominator, minus 2
  var change = post_mean
    .abs()
    .subtract(pre_mean.abs())
    .divide(denom)
    .abs()
    .subtract(2.5);
   
  // Return t-value for each pixel
  return change;
}
```

We filter Sentinel-1 radar images by selecting the VH polarization band and the most common orbit number, then separately process ASCENDING and DESCENDING orbits to reduce directional noise. Also, we use NDVI to reduce vegetation disturbance (NDVI \> 0.2: vegetation)(Wang, X. and Li, P. (2020), USGS (2018)).

``` js
// ---------------------------------------------- Satellite Image  ----------------------------------------------
// Select Sentinel 1 images collection for analysis
function filter_s1(path) {
  var s1 = ee
    .ImageCollection("COPERNICUS/S1_GRD")
    .filter(ee.Filter.listContains("transmitterReceiverPolarisation", "VH"))
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq("instrumentMode", "IW"))
    .filter(ee.Filter.eq("orbitProperties_pass", path))
    .filterBounds(aoi)
    .filterDate(startDate, endDate)
    .select("VH");

  var orbit = s1
    .aggregate_array("relativeOrbitNumber_start")
    .reduce(ee.Reducer.mode());

  s1 = s1.filter(ee.Filter.eq("relativeOrbitNumber_start", orbit));

  // Return change in t-value
  var change = ttest(s1, SHOCK_DATE, PRE_INTERVAL, POST_INTERVAL)
  return change;
}

// Select sentinel image for calculation
var ascending_image = filter_s1("ASCENDING");
var descending_image = filter_s1("DESCENDING");
var asc_des = ee.ImageCollection([ascending_image, descending_image])
  .median() // use median to reduce impacts of outliers
  .clip(aoi);

// Add NDVI Mask
var s2 = ee.ImageCollection('COPERNICUS/S2_SR')
  .filterDate(startDate, SHOCK_DATE)
  .filterBounds(aoi)
  .select(['B4','B8'])
  .median(); 
var ndvi = s2.normalizedDifference(['B8','B4']).rename('NDVI');
var ndvi_mask = ndvi.gt(0.2);

// Generate Composite Image
var composite_image = asc_des.where(ndvi_mask, 0);
```

Then we overlay the t-test output with building and road layers to estimate the number of damaged buildings and roads in each city. As roads are sensitive to neighboring pixels, we defined damaged roads with at least 50% significant pixels.

``` js
// ----------------------------------------------- Analysis  ----------------------------------------------

// Select significant pixel where t-value is positive (95% confidence interval)
var threshold = composite_image.updateMask(composite_image.gt(0));

// Detect damaged buildings and roads
var damaged_building = threshold.reduceRegions({
  collection: buildings,
  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),
  scale: 10
});

var damaged_roads = threshold.reduceRegions({
  collection: roads,
  reducer: ee.Reducer.mean(),
  scale: 10
});

// -------------------------------------- Calculation  ----------------------------------------------
// Calculate the number of damaged buildings/roads by cities 
//Buildings
var mariupol_buildings = damaged_building.filterBounds(ukr1).filter(ee.Filter.gt("mean", 0));
var kharkiv_buildings = damaged_building.filterBounds(ukr7).filter(ee.Filter.gt("mean", 0));
var total_buildings = mariupol_buildings.merge(kharkiv_buildings);

//Roads
var mariupol_roads = damaged_roads.filterBounds(ukr1).filter(ee.Filter.gt("mean", 0.5));
var kharkiv_roads = damaged_roads.filterBounds(ukr7).filter(ee.Filter.gt("mean", 0.5));
var total_roads = mariupol_roads.merge(kharkiv_roads);

// -------------------------------------- Visualization ----------------------------------------------
// Define color palettes for damaged buildings and roads
var palette = ["FFFFFF", "3b528b", "21918c", "5ec962", "fde725"];
var building_palette = ["FFF3D6", "FFDD9E", "FFBE66", "FF9A3D", "FF7519", "FF5100", "FD3000"]; 

// --------------------------------------  Layers ----------------------------------------------
//ttest
Map.addLayer(
  composite_image,
  { min: 0, max: 4, opacity: 0.8, palette: palette },
  "Buildings Change",
  false  // Not displayed by default
);

// Building Footprint Outline
var empty_buildings = ee.Image().byte();
var buildings_outline = empty_buildings.paint({
  featureCollection: damaged_building,
  color: "mean",
  width: 1.5
});

// Draw road outline - add white border
var empty_roads = ee.Image().byte();

// First create a wider white border
var roads_white_outline = empty_roads.paint({
  featureCollection: damaged_roads,
  color: 1,  // White
  width: 9   // Wider than normal width to form a border
});

// Then create normal width colored roads
var roads_outline = empty_roads.paint({
  featureCollection: damaged_roads,
  color: "mean",
  width: 5
});

//  Mapping for checking but displayed by default for user interface design 
// Add building outline layer
Map.addLayer(
  buildings_outline,
  { palette: building_palette, min: 0.6, max: 2 },
  "Damaged Buildings",
  true  // Displayed by default
);

// First add white border layer
Map.addLayer(
  roads_white_outline,
  { palette: ["ffffff"], min: 0, max: 1 },
  "Roads White Outline",
  false  // Not displayed by default
);
// Then add colored road layer
Map.addLayer(
  roads_outline,
  { palette: building_palette, min: 0.6, max: 2 },
  "Damaged Roads",
  false  // Not displayed by default
);

// Add city boundary layer
Map.addLayer(cityBoundaries, {}, 'adminboundaries');
```

## Validations & Limitations

| Color Icon | Color Name       | Damage Level        |
|:-----------|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| 🔵         | Blue              | No damage           |
| 🟢         | Green             | Low damage          |
| 🟡🟠        | Yellow / Orange    | Medium damage       |
| 🔴         | Red               | High levels of damage |

## Placebo Test

![Placebo_Test_1](images/Placebo_Test_1.jpg)
![Placebo_Test_2](images/Placebo_Test_2.jpg)

The placebo test showed cumulative natural disturbances, stronger and seasonal in Kharkiv, and mainly industrial in Mariupol, with visible improvement after vegetation removal.

## T-Test Image Validation by Detection

In the t-test evaluations, our method effectively identified large-scale damage to buildings and roads, supported by the prior separation of built-up areas from open green spaces. 

![T_Test_1](images/T_Test_1.jpg)
![T_Test_2](images/T_Test_2.jpg)

In Area A, structural damage was accurately detected without interference from surrounding vegetation; in Area B, major building footprint damage was captured with slight spatial overflow; and in Area C, gaps between adjacent row houses were clearly distinguished. On roads, the model correctly detected heavily damaged sections alongside buildings in Area D, but misclassified a functioning road in Area E as moderately damaged.

---

## T-Test Image Validation with UNOSAT Data

In addition, we compared our outcome to UNOSAT data to validate the model's performance to detect damaged buildings. *(UNOSAT, cited in Dietrich et al., 2025)*

---

## Analysis

```python
# Label ground truth and predicted damage status
ukr1_all = ukr1_all.copy()

# Label ground truth: check if building is marked damaged by UNOSAT
ukr1_all['gt_damaged'] = ukr1_all.geometry.apply(
    lambda geom: ukr1_unosat.intersects(geom).any()
)

# Label prediction: check if building geometry intersects GEE detected damage
ukr1_all['pred_damaged'] = ukr1_all.geometry.apply(
    lambda geom: ukr1_gee.intersects(geom).any()
)

### Kharkiv with 95% confidence interval

| Metric        | Value  |
|:--------------|:-------|
| TP (True Positive)  | 751    |
| FP (False Positive) | 72650  |

| Specificity   | 0.3727 |
| Accuracy      | 0.3764 |
| F1 Score      | 0.0202 |

Conclusively, using a 99% confidence interval improved predictive performance. In Mariupol, the F1 score reached 0.4684, demonstrating reasonable effectiveness, while Kharkiv's F1 score remained low at 0.0234.

Performance limitations were likely linked to natural disturbances, pixel spill-over effects caused by the resolution constraints of 10-metre imagery, temporal mismatches with manual labels due to the cumulative nature of warfare destruction and unclear damage definitions, and missing road footprint and subtype data.

While the method remains valuable for preliminary screening by international organisations, future improvements should prioritize refined preprocessing, clearer damage definitions, multi-temporal validation, and the potential integration of supervised learning techniques to enhance overall accuracy.
