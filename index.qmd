# Assessing Urban War Damage in Kharkiv and Mariupol, Ukraine Using Sentinel-1 Imagery

## Project Summary

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### Problem Statement

What is the problem you’re trying to address using this application?

This application addresses the need for transparent, cost-effective tools to assess infrastructure damage in urban areas affected by the Russia–Ukraine war. It focuses on Kharkiv and Mariupol, the two most affected cities, and estimates building and road damage using a lightweight, unsupervised pixel-wise t-test on freely available Sentinel-1 imagery. Although the war is ongoing, our analysis focuses on the year before and after February 24, 2022, when the full-scale invasion began. Unlike deep learning approaches requiring expensive optical imagery, this method supports repeatable, scalable, and interpretable analysis. The results can assist post-war reconstruction planning, guide humanitarian aid, and inform public understanding of urban destruction patterns in these cities.

### End User

Who are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?

1.  Government and planning departments: Initial analyze damage patterns and damage to specific facilities (e.g. housing, hospitals) to prioritise reconstruction and allocate resources effectively.
2.  Humanitarian organisations: Quickly identify severely damaged areas and assess damage to critical infrastructure and residential areas to provide guidance for emergency shelter, public health and logistics planning.
3.  Remote sensing and disaster assessment professionals: Use damage data to validate models, track changes, and compare methods or datasets in disaster impact studies.
4.  Public and media: Explore clear, visual maps of war damage, thereby raising public awareness, and can provide data to support news reporting.

### Data

What data are you using?

-   Sentinel-1 Imagery\
    This application uses Sentinel-1 Imagery provided by [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/sentinel1). To simplify processing and prioritize sensitivity to structural damage, only VH-polarized imagery was used. The data spans February 24, 2020 to February 24, 2023, covering placebo, pre-war, and war phases. From February 2022, imagery was compared monthly to capture temporal changes in damage.

-   Building Footprints\
    Building footprint data is sourced from the [Overture Maps Foundation](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/buildings/#14/32.58453/-117.05154/0/60), which combines several open datasets, primarily from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft, and Google Open Buildings. Buildings smaller than 50 m² were excluded due to potential building false positives and the resolution of Sentinel-1.

-   Road Networks\
    The road network data was retrieved from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) using the OSMnx package in Python, extracting roads classified as trunk, primary, secondary, and tertiary, and simplifying bidirectional edges.

### Methodology

How are you using this data to address the problem?

We used Sentinel-1 SAR imagery to perform a pixel statistical test (t-test) for pre- and post-war changes, identifying potential damage on the map. Overlaying the building footprints and road network data with t-test results to locate and classify damage, and calculate the percentage of damaged buildings and roads, and different subtypes of damaged buildings at 95% confidence intervals. Through monthly monitoring of post-war damages for 12 months after 2022-2-24, the evolution of the war impact will be tracked, and user can select different times to view changes in damages. These features will support urban damage assessment and post-war reconstruction planning.

### Interface

How does your application's interface work to address the needs of your end user?

The application provides clear, visual maps of war damage, enabling the public and researchers in remote sensing and disaster assessment to track the evolution of destruction and the recovery process over time. Layer comparison tools help Ukrainian government and humanitarian organizations visually identify specific areas are affected, supporting resource planning and decision-making for wartime relief and post-disaster reconstruction. The application also calculates the proportion of damaged buildings and roads, and visualizes the distribution of damage across different building types, offering reference statistics for researchers. All users can export damaged building GeoJSON data to conduct urban assessments and make data-driven decisions.

## How it Works

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

``` js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:
